## Q1

Convert Minutes into Seconds

Have the user input an integer in minutes, and then convert this into seconds.

Make sure the input and output are just the same as the samples. 

| Sample Input 1 | Sample Output 1 |
|:--:|:--:|
| `30` | `1800 seconds` |

| Sample Input 2 | Sample Output 2 |
|:--:|:--:|
| `5` | `300 seconds` |

## Q2

Jane always gets at least twice as many birthday cards as her older sister Cruella. 

Write a program that tells you how many cards Jane gets as a minimum. 

Input will be a positive integer representing how many cards Cruella received for her last birthday.

| Sample Input 1 | Sample Output 1 |
|:--:|:--:|
| `7` | `Jane receives at least 14 cards.` |

| Sample Input 2 | Sample Output 2 |
|:--:|:--:|
| `59` | `Jane receives at least 118 cards.` |

## Q3

Age to Days

Let the user take their age (in years) and convert this to the equivalent number of days. 

> Note: Use 365 days as the length for a year

Ignore leap years and days between last birthday and now. (So they just turned the age they inputted)

| Sample Input 1 | Sample Output 1 |
|:--:|:--:|
| Enter your age in years: `65` | `You are 23725 days old.` |

| Sample Input 2 | Sample Output 2 |
|:--:|:--:|
| Enter your age in years: `20` | `You are 7300 days old.` |

### Q3.1

Expand this further by telling the user (i.e. output) how many days it will take for the user to reach 100 years old. 

| Sample Input 1.1 | Sample Output 1.1 |
|:--:|:--:|
| Enter your age in years: `65` | `You are 23725 days old. In 12775 days you will be 100 years old!` |
